### Research Project Details

* What is the focus of your research project?

The use of natural language processing( NLP) in cybersecurity is gaining popularityin the cybersecurity domain.It can used to support risk assessments. It can also help identify threats that can help identify the vulnerabilities in the security infrastructure. There is a need for real-world applications for spotting and preventing cyberattacks, even though the majority of current research has concentrated on theoretical aspects of NLP in cybersecurity.NLP can also provide a leverage to assist in breach protection,identification and scope analysis.

* State at least one research question that your project will answer.

The project will answer the following research questions:
1) What are the practical applications of NLP in cybersecurity for detecting and preventing cyber attacks?
2) How can NLP be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cybersecurity risk assessments?
3) How can NLP be used to detect and prevent phishing attacks?

* What are the steps you will need to take to complete this project?
