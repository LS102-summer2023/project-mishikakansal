### Research Project Details

* What is the focus of your research project?

The use of natural language processing( NLP) in cybersecurity is gaining popularityin the cybersecurity domain.It can used to support risk assessments. It can also help identify threats that can help identify the vulnerabilities in the security infrastructure. There is a need for real-world applications for spotting and preventing cyberattacks, even though the majority of current research has concentrated on theoretical aspects of NLP in cybersecurity.NLP can also provide a leverage to assist in breach protection,identification and scope analysis.

* State at least one research question that your project will answer.

The project will answer the following research questions:
1) What are the practical applications of NLP in cybersecurity for detecting and preventing cyber attacks?
2) What are the ethical considerations when using NLP in cybersecurity, and how can they be addressed in practical applications?
3) How can NLP be used to detect and prevent phishing attacks?

* What are the steps you will need to take to complete this project?

The following steps will be taken to complete the project:

Step 1: To determine the state of knowledge regarding NLP's practical applications in cybersecurity, conduct a thorough literature review.

Step 2: Create research questions to address the gaps in the literature by identifying them.

Step 3: Collecting and analysing the data to answer the research question

Step 4: Developing and testing NLP models for preventing phishing attacks 

Step 5: Evaluating the model and its effectiveness and comparing it with the current cybersecurity techniques and tools.

Step 6: Identifying the ethical considerations while using the NLP model and assessing them.
