### Introduction

The ability of a computer program to understand and interpret human language as they are spoken or written is known as Natural Language Processing(NLP).The main objective of Nlp is to make sense of human language in a valuable manner. Over the last decade significant progress has been made in the field of NLP based on Machine Learning(ML).Along with the development of NLP, cyber threats have significantly increased. Any activity, person has has the potential to delete, alter, deny data without permission comes under cyber threats. This paper describes an NLP model based on ML model specialized in the cybersecurity field. Threat intelligence solution employs NLP to read through data and find the pattern and trends in them.

### Related work

TODO: This section includes a broad and detailed review of relevant existing work. The literature review should provide background and context for the reseach project work. The subsections may be organized in whatever manner seems best suited to the material-- chronological, or by topic, or according to some other criteria (e.g., primary versus secondary resources).

If ethical issues are central to this work, you should also address historical and contemporary issues or efforts made to address them.

### Prototype

TODO: This section describes the implemented prototype - how did you implement your prototype, including the overall design of your prototype, details of the algorithms and tools if any used, etc. Use technical diagrams, equations, algorithms, and paragraphs of text to describe the research that you have completed. Be sure to number all figures and tables and to explicitly refer to them in your text.

### Experiments

TODO: This section describes your experimental set up and evaluation. It should also produce and describe the results of your study. The subsection titles below offer a typical structure used for this section.

#### Experimental Design

TODO: Especially as it pertains to responsible computing, if conducting experiments or evaluations that involve particular ethical considerations, detail those issues here.

#### Evaluation

TODO

#### Threats to Validity

TODO: What are some considerations and choices you have made during your project that might compromise some of your presented results (for example, if you are using data could there be sources of data inaccuracy, or if you are relying on an existing tool or library, a potential inaccuracy in their work might result to inaccuracy in yours).

### Conclusion

TODO: Traditionally, this section addresses the areas proposed below as subsections, although not necessarily in this order or organized as offered.
