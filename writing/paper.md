### Introduction

The ability of a computer program to understand and interpret human language as they are spoken or written is known as Natural Language Processing(NLP).NLP's main objective is to make it possible for computers to comprehend, interpret, and produce natural language in a manner similar to that of humans.NLP entails a number of steps that, when combined, produce the desired result. It is employed for the analysis, comprehension, and production of natural language text and speech.In order to study the rules and structure of language and develop intelligent systems capable of comprehending, analysing, and extracting meaning from text, linguistics and computer science are combined in NLP.


NLP is used in many ways across a variety of fields and industries.Translation, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition are a few examples. NLP techniques are utilized in speech recognition systems to translate spoken language into written text as well as in search engines to extract pertinent information from vast amounts of text.NLP is regarded as a challenging field in computer science since human language is rarely precise or plainly articulated. Knowing human language requires knowing not only the words but also the thoughts and connections that underlie them. In the following years, there could be a lot of advancement, especially in cybersecurity.


Because there are more users, devices, and software in the modern company, along with a flood of private and sensitive data, cybersecurity is becoming more and more crucial. The issue is made worse by the increase in the number, level of skill, and number of cyberattackers. Cybersecurity is essential for defending against a range of online risks, such as cybercrime, cyberattacks, and cyberterrorism. People and businesses use it to prevent illegal access to data centers and other digital systems.



The importance of cybersecurity in the online world cannot be overstated. As we rely more and more on online activities like banking, chatting, and shopping, the risk of cybercrime increases. Our systems and data are protected by cybersecurity from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, interception, and data deletion.

### Related work

TODO: This section includes a broad and detailed review of relevant existing work. The literature review should provide background and context for the reseach project work. The subsections may be organized in whatever manner seems best suited to the material-- chronological, or by topic, or according to some other criteria (e.g., primary versus secondary resources).


The field of NLP has gained a significant amount of attention in the domain of cybersecurity. While most of the research related works focus on the theoretical aspect here are some studies that have focused on the practical application:

"Natural Language Processing Model for Automatic Analysis of Cybersecurity-Related Documents" This paper discusses the development and implementation of an NLP model based on machine learning performing analysis for cybersecurity related document.(2)
"Review of NLP-based Systems in Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity" This paper discussed the use of AI and NLP applications for cybersecurity including data mining,pattern recognitions and expert systems. (3)
"Cyber Security Vulnerability Detection Using Natural Language Processing" This paper develops a system targetting software vulnerability detection as a NLP problem. (4)
"Cybersecurity Vulnerability Classification Utilizing Natural Language Processing Methods" This research is utilising NLP and some deep learning models to classify vulnerabilities (5)

If ethical issues are central to this work, you should also address historical and contemporary issues or efforts made to address them.

### Prototype

TODO: This section describes the implemented prototype - how did you implement your prototype, including the overall design of your prototype, details of the algorithms and tools if any used, etc. Use technical diagrams, equations, algorithms, and paragraphs of text to describe the research that you have completed. Be sure to number all figures and tables and to explicitly refer to them in your text.

### Experiments
